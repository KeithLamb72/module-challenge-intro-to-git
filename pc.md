## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in computer files also to find out the why and how the files were changed.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?Github is a version control system while github is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
3. Why do we create a branch? so we can double check if those are the changes we want to make before mergining it with the main or master codes
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Pull requests give you the ability to tell others what changes you've pushed through to the repository and lets us have a peer review system.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd ~ is the command to go back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git pull donwloands content from remote repository and connects it to the Working Directory, git fetch is used to download contents from a remote repository and then stores it in a seperate branch in your local repository, git merge helps merge branches together into a single branch.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differneces in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Open the file and make any necessary changes. After just git add. and git commit-m'text' then git push and that should resolve the merge conflict also giving you a corrected branch to be able to do a new merge.
